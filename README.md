- One of my first projects made for a student from my group at the university.
- The main idea is to enter characters from the keyboard, which the computer compares through the event loop with virtual keys imported from a file,
  determining whether the user made a mistake or entered the correct character.
- A second stream has been implemented to track time and, accordingly, measure the speed of printing.
